									<h3 >DeepEnsemble: A Novel Brain Wave Classification <br/> in MI-BCI using Ensemble of Deep Learners</h3>
									<hr>
								
								<p>The project was undertaken during the first year of my Master's studies (2022-2023) and was supported by the 
									<a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp"> Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada</a>.
									It was a collaborative effort with Arshad Mehtiyev (M.A.), with Prof. Marzieh Amini and 
									Prof. Hamidreza Sadreazami providing supervision. <br/> <br/> 
	
									The project included a development of a DeepEnsemble model, an innovative deep learning-based solution, to classify EEG signals 
									for right hand and right leg movements in a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. Integrating diverse Deep Learning models like
									Transformers, MLP, CNN, XGboost and Hybrid models through an ensemble approach for enhanced accuracy. <br/>  
									We were able to outperform state-of-the-art methods, culminating in presentation and publication at the 
									<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10043385"> IEEE 41st International Conference on

									 <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
									 <p>
										Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are rapidly growing in neurorehabilitation to realize communication
										 for consumers with disabilities. This work proposes a classification approach for the motor imagery 
										 BCI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using the recent advances in deep learning methods. 
										 The proposed DeepEnsemble method combines different deep learning models in an ensemble learning with soft voting. 
										 More specifically, multi-layer perceptron, vision transformer, convolutional neural network and its integration with
										  distributed gradient boosting methods are explored separately and combined in an ensemble learning model. 
										  The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset. It is shown that the proposed ensemble 
										  learning method significantly improves the classification accuracy of the EEG signals across various subjects
										   as compared to some of the existing methods.

									 <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
									 <p>
										This project utilizes FWB data from both pre- and post-COVID-19 surveys conducted by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada
										 (FCAC) to develop a machine learning model that can predict Canadians' FWB status and the potential impact of future global
										  shocks. The project aims to investigate whether the key factors contributing to FWB change when ignoring COVID-19, and
										   whether the same set of features can accurately predict FWB in both pre- and post-COVID-19 datasets. 
										   The results show that FWB is disproportionately distributed across the nation. 
										   The key drivers of FWB include: household financial situation, capacity to meet monthly expenses, saving, credit score.
										   Besides, the analysis showed that the prediction of FWB has a higher level of accuracy when global shocks are not 
										   accounted for. This showed the significant disruptive effects the pandemic induced across sectors and individuals. 
										   The project advocates for an increasing effort from the government to help Canadians across provinces to better cope 
										   with their finances. Addressing this issue involves creating better jobs, a review of minimum wages, 
										   controlling inflation, supporting debt relief including mortgage, and further assistance to households in the 
										   lowest income deciles, among others. Particular attention should be given to groups that are usually left-behind 
										   such as women and single mothers, persons living with disability and indigenous communities.

								<h3>DETECTING RISKY VEGETATION ENCROAHMENT ON <br/>  POWERLINES VIA MOBILE AND AIRBORNE LASER SCANNED <br/> POINT CLOUDS</h3>
								<hr>
								<p> During my second year of Master's studies (2022-2023), I successfully completed a one-year project that received
									support through a research contract from <a href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/home"> Natural Resources 
									Canada (NRCan)</a>. The main objective was to
									predict powerline failures using LiDAR data, which drove the development of an innovative deep 
									learning-based solution for encroachment detection.<br/> <br/> 
									Conducted under the guidance and supervision of Professors <a href="https://carleton.ca/marziehamini/">Marzieh Amini</a>, 
									<a href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/green/green.php">James Green</a>, and 
									<a href="https://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/rajan/">Sareerman Rajan</a>, the project involved thorough data preprocessing and cleaning. I employed an array
									   of technologies including Python (ArcGIS, Keras, PyTorch), C programming, and Cloud Compare to ensure
										the accuracy and reliability of the data.<br/> <br/> 
										One of the notable contributions was the implementation of a novel point-based encroachment detection 
										algorithm. This algorithm exhibited exceptional efficiency and achieved an impressive precision rate 
										of 98% in identifying encroachments across diverse datasets obtained from different locations such as 
										Surrey, Toronto, and Ottawa. This outcome demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the solution 
										we developed.<br/> <br/> 
										Furthermore, the culmination of this project led to the creation of a journal article that has been 
										submitted to the IEEE Sensors Journal for publication. Once the paper achieves acceptance, I will 
										promptly share the link to provide access to the findings and insights derived from this research endeavor.

									<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

								<p>
									The Internet of Things (IoT) industry has expanded significantly in recent years by adopting new 
									technologies and integrating with existing ones. With this expansion, the vulnerability to security 
									breaches has escalated, leading to greater financial implications and posing a direct risk to 
									individuals' well-being. In this project, we summarized the security aspects of these systems and 
									discussed the solutions proposed in the literature. We first explored what is called “security 
									landscape”, which refers to the unique characteristics of IoT and the security implications they 
									have. Subsequently, different security attacks and their mitigations have been presented. These
									threats can target various aspects of an IoT infrastructure, from the sensor devices and actuators to 
									the cloud and backend services. To provide this information in an organized manner, different 
									threats were analyzed relative to the 4-layer model of IoT. After examining different attack 
									surfaces and their prevention mechanisms, the use of edge computing and blockchain-based 
									technologies as emerging technologies were discussed. As case studies, the last section of this 
									report contains information about some of the previous well-known security incidents that 
									occurred in the field. These details include the security flaws that caused these security attacks, the 
									damages they imposed, and the lessons learned from them. This report can be useful for any 
									practitioners and developers in the field and can provide a generalized overview of the challenges 
									and possible solutions.

									<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
									<p>
									    The existence of cars started to become dangerous in man-kind life, especially with the massive 
										increase in cars. This increase reached the extent that 1.35 million deaths worldwide due to vehicle 
										crashes [1]. This considerable number of accidents is mainly due to human error and inattention. 
										From here, the idea of self-driving cars came as a good assistant in improving road safety and 
										offering new mobility options for millions of people, especially old-aged and people with low 
										vision. The proposed self-driving car guides itself using visual information from its environment 
										with an HD camera. The data obtained from the camera are sent directly to the Raspberry pi that 
										plays a significant role in sending control signals to different parts of the car. It is worth mentioning 
										that the proposed car will be existent with two modes: Manual with the help of a warning system 
										supported with machine vision algorithms to detect all kinds of obstacles, and autonomous as the 
										car will drive itself and take decisions at the right time. Many companies started to invest in these 
										self-driving cars like "Waymo," which began in 2016 in developing, and in 2020 they started self driving taxi service [2]. The following project can be another step towards more complex and more 
										significant scale projects. It is considered relatively cheap with a cost of 1400 TL. This final design 
										report will explain the design and algorithms used in a self-driving car and describe the subsystems' 
										functionality inside it. It will also explain the concepts used in image processing and control 
										systems, in addition to the results of the tests conducted until reaching the final product. This report 
										also gives user manual explaining in detail how the car can be used, and at the end, some 
										discussions about this project was presented.

								<h3 >Transforming Text: NLP and Transformers <br/> Exploration</h3>
								<hr>
								<p> Welcome to the "Transforming Text: NLP and Transformers Exploration" project. This project is collection 
									of notebooks I built that delves into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its intersection
									 with Transformers, offering an in-depth exploration of various techniques and applications.
									<br/><br/>
									The repository begins with a focus on NLP pre-processing, detailing fundamental techniques such as stopwords 
									removal, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and Unicode normalization. Building on this foundation, the 
									project delves into attention mechanisms in NLP, explaining concepts like encoder-decoder attention, 
									self-attention, bidirectional attention, and multi-head attention.
									<br/><br/>
									Moving into practical applications, the repository covers sentiment analysis using flair and Transformers, 
									named entity recognition with Spacy, open-domain question answering with Elasticsearch, and even extends to 
									projects like analyzing sentiment and organizational entities from Reddit posts. Moreover, it explores 
									similarity search techniques using Transformers and PyTorch. By combining theoretical explanations with 
									hands-on implementation, "Transforming Text" serves as a valuable resource for those looking to understand 
									the nuances of NLP and harness the potential of Transformers in real-world scenarios.
