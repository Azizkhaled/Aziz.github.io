								<h3>Lane-Detection-and-Object-Detection-algorithms-for-Self-Driving-RC-Car</h3>
							</header>
							
							<p>This project was undertaken during the academic year of 2020-2021 as part of my undergraduate thesis.
								 It was a collaborative effort involving Omar Ammar (BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering) 
								 and Mustafa Almoghrabi (M.A. in Telecomunication Engineering), with Prof. Cem DirekoÄŸlu providing supervision.

								<br/> 
								This project comprises both a short report, full report, Project Demonstration video both of which 
								are available for review.
								 The full report can be accessed via this link: <a href="images\AutoRC\Final report E-visioneers.pdf">
									 Auto RC report</a>.
								  Additionally, you can view the demonstrattion video on YouTube by clicking here:

								 <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
								 <p>
									The existence of cars started to become dangerous in man-kind life, especially with the massive 
increase in cars. This increase reached the extent that 1.35 million deaths worldwide due to vehicle 
crashes [1]. This considerable number of accidents is mainly due to human error and inattention. 
From here, the idea of self-driving cars came as a good assistant in improving road safety and 
offering new mobility options for millions of people, especially old-aged and people with low 
vision. The proposed self-driving car guides itself using visual information from its environment 
with an HD camera. The data obtained from the camera are sent directly to the Raspberry pi that 
plays a significant role in sending control signals to different parts of the car. It is worth mentioning 
that the proposed car will be existent with two modes: Manual with the help of a warning system 
supported with machine vision algorithms to detect all kinds of obstacles, and autonomous as the 
car will drive itself and take decisions at the right time. Many companies started to invest in these 
self-driving cars like "Waymo," which began in 2016 in developing, and in 2020 they started self driving taxi service [2]. The following project can be another step towards more complex and more 
significant scale projects. It is considered relatively cheap with a cost of 1400 TL. This final design 
report will explain the design and algorithms used in a self-driving car and describe the subsystems' 
functionality inside it. It will also explain the concepts used in image processing and control 
systems, in addition to the results of the tests conducted until reaching the final product. This report 
also gives user manual explaining in detail how the car can be used, and at the end, some 
discussions about this project was presented
