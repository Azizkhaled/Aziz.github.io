								<h3>Securing the IoT Landscape: Threats, Mitigations, and Emerging Technologies</h3>
							</header>
							
							<p> The project was undertaken during the second year of my Master's studies (2022-2023) during the introduction to Internet of Things  
								course with Prof. Mohamed Ibn Kahla. 
								The project was a collaborative effort with Iman Alavi Fazel (M.A.), Mahmoud Selim (M.A.), Shakir Sayed (M.A.), with 
								Prof. Mohamed Ibn Kahla providing supervision. <br/>  <br/> 

								This project is about examining the security challenges and solutions within the Internet of Things (IoT) industry in 2023, given its 
								significant growth and increasing vulnerability to security breaches. It delves into the unique security landscape of IoT, 
								analyzes various security attacks and their mitigations across different layers of IoT infrastructure, and discusses emerging 
								technologies like edge computing and blockchain for enhancing security. The project also includes case studies of notable security
								incidents, aiming to provide a comprehensive resource for practitioners and developers in the field to better understand and address 
								IoT security concerns. <br/>  <br/> 

								The project comprises both a <a href="images\IotSecurity\SecurityInIoT_FinalReport.pdf">full project report</a> with all findings and solutions, 
								and weekly update  <a href="images\IotSecurity\IoT_Presentation.pdf">presentation slides</a>, all of wich are available for review.

								<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

								<p>
									The Internet of Things (IoT) industry has expanded significantly in recent years by adopting new 
									technologies and integrating with existing ones. With this expansion, the vulnerability to security 
									breaches has escalated, leading to greater financial implications and posing a direct risk to 
									individuals' well-being. In this project, we summarized the security aspects of these systems and 
									discussed the solutions proposed in the literature. We first explored what is called “security 
									landscape”, which refers to the unique characteristics of IoT and the security implications they 
									have. Subsequently, different security attacks and their mitigations have been presented. These
									threats can target various aspects of an IoT infrastructure, from the sensor devices and actuators to 
									the cloud and backend services. To provide this information in an organized manner, different 
									threats were analyzed relative to the 4-layer model of IoT. After examining different attack 
									surfaces and their prevention mechanisms, the use of edge computing and blockchain-based 
									technologies as emerging technologies were discussed. As case studies, the last section of this 
									report contains information about some of the previous well-known security incidents that 
									occurred in the field. These details include the security flaws that caused these security attacks, the 
									damages they imposed, and the lessons learned from them. This report can be useful for any 
									practitioners and developers in the field and can provide a generalized overview of the challenges 
									and possible solutions.
